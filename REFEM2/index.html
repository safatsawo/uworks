                <h1>REVIVAL FLAMES EVANGELISTIC MISSIONS</h1>
                <p>When you walk by faith—when you do what the Bible says —you're an oddity to others, even in the church world. They think something is wrong with you because you don't worry. After I was healed, I started praying for the sick. I anointed
                    folks with oil. That didn't go over too well with the Baptists. I was never an ordained Baptist preacher, although they offered to ordain me. They can ordain you in the local church. In fact, the pastor said, "We'll ordain you, Kenneth,
                    on one condition: if you'll tone down just a little bit on this healing business. Go ahead and preach a little prayer and faith if you want to, but just tone down on this healing business." I said, "I was planning on toning up on it!"
                    I didn't pray for anybody publicly back then. I'd preach it publicly, but would pray for them privately, and I was planning to start praying publicly for them. That's the reason I said, "I was planning on toning up on it." I never
                    will forget it. When I told the pastor that, he said, "Well, just forget it, then. Just forget it," and walked off and left me. And I don't remember ever seeing him again. Then, of course, when I got the baptism of the Holy Spirit
                    and spoke with other tongues, I did get "the left foot of fellowship" sure enough. I came over among the Full Gospel people. They had the baptism of the Holy Spirit—they spoke with other tongues—and I was sure they were all sprouting
                    wings. It took me a little while to find out that those weren't wings they were sprouting; those were just their shoulder blades sticking out! I took a Full Gospel church to pastor, and being new in Full Gospel circles, I didn't know
                    that nobody else would pastor this church. It was a "trouble" church. But God told me to take it. I guess the reason was because He knew I wouldn't worry about it. In those days, it was a common practice to have a pastors' fellowship
                    meeting the first Monday of every month. I'd go and .</p>
